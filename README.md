### NLP PoliSense: AI-driven Analytical Platform for Political Bias and Sentiment Ranking

## 1.1 Project Overview and Motivation 

The rapid consumption of news through online media, particularly in the sociopolitical domain, has amplified the impact of partisan reporting and ideological bias. Users are increasingly subjected to content within algorithmic echo chambers, making it difficult to gauge the objective position or sentiment expressed towards political subjects (DeVos, 2021). 

## 1.2 Objective

This project proposes the development of **PoliSense: An AI-driven Analytical Platform for Political Bias and Sentiment Ranking**, an end-to-end NLP application designed to aggregate articles from diverse sources, analyse the inherent bias and sentiment using a fine-tuned Transformer model, and provide a clear, quantifiable ranking of news sources based on their objective and affective content. PoliSense not only offers real-time, multi-dimensional analysis of news articles but also delivers superior interpretability of bias, addressing a significant gap in many existing platforms. This work aims to leverage advanced text classification techniques to address the critical need for transparent media analysis, offering users a tool to navigate the polarised information landscape.
